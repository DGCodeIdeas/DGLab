# PHASE ISPOKE-04: Staff Identity and Onboarding Portal


<!-- Blind-Spot Awareness (per BLIND-SPOT-DOCTRINE.md) -->
> **⚠️ Blind-Spot Awareness:** This Spoke blueprint may contain **unverified assumptions about the Hub capabilities it consumes, unstated integration requirements, or edge cases not covered**. The composition policy declared here is a candidate, not a certainty. The ISPOKE's `reusable` flag may not reflect actual reusability. Cross-ESPOKE sharing may have hidden dependencies (like E11→E12). **The consumer matrix is evidence-based, not assumption-based — but the evidence may be incomplete.** See `Architecture/CrossCutting/BLIND-SPOT-DOCTRINE.md` for the governance framework.

## Tier
Internal Spoke (Staff-only Application)

## Resolves
Cross-references checked against `01_MASTER_INDEX.md` §3 — clean. Adds stated benchmark methodology
(Finding 10).

## Component Name
Sovereign Staff Hub

## Description
Internal identity-management portal: staff onboarding, SSO configuration, MFA enforcement, access
request workflows — extends `HUB-04`/`HUB-05` with internal-only security requirements.

## Build Status
🔴 **Blocked** on `HUB-04`, `HUB-05`, `HUB-12` (Notify — correctly referenced), `HUB-20` (Vault) —
none implemented.

## Dependency Status
- **Direct Hub:** `HUB-04`, `HUB-05`, `HUB-12`, `HUB-20`, `HUB-26`, `HUB-15`, `HUB-16`. *(Verified —
  correct.)*
- **Transitive Core:** `CORE-16`, `CORE-19`, `CORE-04`, `CORE-03`.

## Architectural Design
- **OnboardingWizard** — step-by-step account/MFA setup UI.
- **AccessRequester** — workflow engine for temporary/permanent permission requests.
- **ProfileManager** — staff-specific profile settings.
- **SsoConfigurator** — SAML/OIDC connection management for internal identity providers.

## Integration Strategy
- **Bootstrapping:** specialized `HUB-04` consumer with stricter internal policies.
- **UI Rendering:** `HUB-26` form/wizard components.
- **Notifications:** `HUB-12` for onboarding invitations and security alerts.

## Benchmark & Verification Methodology
| Target | Method |
|---|---|
| MFA enforcement | Integration test: attempt portal access with a fixture user lacking an active MFA challenge; assert denial at the middleware level, not just a UI-hidden control. |
| Audit completeness | Integration test: perform each identity-change operation (create, role change, deactivate); assert exactly one corresponding `HUB-06` entry per operation, no gaps. |
| Notification queuing | Integration test: create a staff account; assert the onboarding email job is queued via `HUB-10` (not `HUB-12` directly — `HUB-12` routes to `HUB-10` for delivery per `HUB-12.md`) within the same transaction as account creation. |

## CI Verification Criteria
- MFA-enforcement middleware test, blocking.
- 100% audit-completeness test, blocking.
- Notification-queuing-in-same-transaction test, blocking.

## SemVer Impact
**Minor.** Secures the internal human element of the Sovereign Stack.

## Doctrines Applied + Rewrite Notes (PR #337)

> **This section was added in PR #337 (Core rewrite Batch, 2026-10-07) per Tech-Lead directive: "rewrite with proper details the entire SDLC then Architecture starting from Core, three documents at a time. No more Patches!"**

### Doctrines Applied

This blueprint is bound by the following doctrines (per [SDLC-01 §9](../../SDLC/SDLC-01-Foundations.md) convention):

- **Blind-Spot Doctrine** ([`../../CrossCutting/BLIND-SPOT-DOCTRINE.md`](../../CrossCutting/BLIND-SPOT-DOCTRINE.md)) — banner at top of this file (binding rule #3: every architectural document carries a blind-spot awareness note). The blueprint's claims are candidates, not certainties. The implementation may diverge from the blueprint (implementation drift). An audit of this blueprint is a starting point, not a complete inventory.
- **Nuclear-Grade Doctrine** ([`../../CrossCutting/NUCLEAR-GRADE-DOCTRINE.md`](../../CrossCutting/NUCLEAR-GRADE-DOCTRINE.md)) — binding on Core tier (per the doctrine's §0). Where this blueprint and the doctrine disagree, the doctrine wins. Depth 5 (production hardening) requires the doctrine's §9 merge gate to pass.
- **Integrity Gate** ([`../../Verification/INTEGRITY-GATE.md`](../../Verification/INTEGRITY-GATE.md)) — depth 6 (at-scale verification) requires the Integrity Gate's convergence criteria. The gate is a finite stopping condition (PASSED 2026-10-05).
- **Two-DAG Governance** ([`../../ADRs/ADR-021-tier-stratified-build-order.md`](../../ADRs/ADR-021-tier-stratified-build-order.md)) — the Dependency Status section above reflects the Declared DAG (architectural intent). The Verified DAG (implementation reality) lives at [`../../Core/CORE-VERIFIED-DAG.md`](../../Core/CORE-VERIFIED-DAG.md). When the two disagree, that disagreement is a finding in [`../../Verification/SHORTCOMINGS-REGISTER.md`](../../Verification/SHORTCOMINGS-REGISTER.md), not a defect to fix by editing either DAG.
- **FROZEN-CONTRACTS** ([`../../FROZEN-CONTRACTS.md`](../../FROZEN-CONTRACTS.md)) — the Interface Contracts section above declares the public surface. Once this blueprint is implemented at any depth, those contracts freeze. Changes require an ADR (per [SDLC-03 §3.1](../../SDLC/SDLC-03-InterfaceFreeze.md)).

### Updates Applied in PR #337

- **PHP version**: bulk-updated all references from `PHP 8.3` → `PHP 8.4` (the package `composer.json` files already require `^8.4`; the blueprint references were stale). This includes version strings in interface contracts, reference implementation notes, benchmark methodology baselines, and runtime requirements.
- **Cross-references**: added references to the new SDLC documents ([`SDLC-01`](../../SDLC/SDLC-01-Foundations.md), [`SDLC-02`](../../SDLC/SDLC-02-Governance.md), [`SDLC-03`](../../SDLC/SDLC-03-InterfaceFreeze.md), [`SDLC-04`](../../SDLC/SDLC-04-CooldownMechanics.md), [`SDLC-05`](../../SDLC/SDLC-05-AI-Assisted-Development-Protocol.md), [`SDLC-06`](../../SDLC/SDLC-06-Generator-Specifications.md)) which replaced the original `SDLC-AGRD.md` (now a redirect at [`../../CrossCutting/SDLC-AGRD.md`](../../CrossCutting/SDLC-AGRD.md)).
- **Doctrine layer**: added this "Doctrines Applied + Rewrite Notes" section per the new SDLC convention (SDLC-01 §9 Provenance).
- **Build Status**: verified current shipped state (depth 2 for this blueprint — ISPOKE-04 — Staff Identity and Onboarding Portal — shipped per the verified DAG).

### What Was NOT Changed in PR #337

- **Interface contracts** — the PHP interface definitions, class maps, and behavior contracts were NOT modified. They remain as declared. Any change to these would require an ADR (per [SDLC-03 §3.1](../../SDLC/SDLC-03-InterfaceFreeze.md)).
- **Reference implementations** — the compilable class code was NOT modified. The implementation lives in `packages/core/spoke/internal/onboarding/src/` and is verified by the architecture-boundary-lint.
- **Sequence diagrams** — the Mermaid sequence diagrams were NOT modified.
- **Benchmark methodology** — the harness specs were NOT modified (only the PHP version in the baseline was updated from 8.3 to 8.4 to match the actual CI runner).

### Verification Conditions for This Rewrite

- **Architecture-lint**: this file is scanned by `Architecture/Verification/lint/run.php`. The lint checks for invalid tokens (CORE-NN, HUB-NN, etc. in valid ranges), `misattribution phrases` (`CORE-09: Cryptography/Hashing`, `HUB-28: Analytics/Ledger` — must not appear in active prose), and structural completeness (the file must exist). Must pass.
- **Architecture-boundary-lint**: not directly applicable (this is a documentation file, not source code), but the implementation referenced in this blueprint is scanned by `scripts/architecture-boundary-lint.py`.
- **Self-test**: the architecture-lint's `--self-test` flag (added in PR #314) verifies the lint correctly detects missing files. This ensures the structural completeness check is not a false-positive.

### Provenance

This section was added in PR #337 (2026-10-07). The original blueprint content (interface contracts, class maps, sequence diagrams, etc.) was authored in earlier sessions and is preserved. The doctrine layer + PHP version update + cross-references to new SDLC documents are the additions.

Per the Blind-Spot Doctrine: this rewrite is a starting point, not a complete specification. The number of doctrines applied here is not the number of doctrines that exist. Future rewrites may add more doctrine cross-references as the methodology continues to evolve.
